# Booking API Testing Project

This project contains automated API tests for the **Booking API**, focusing on the end-to-end validation of booking-related functionalities. It leverages **Postman** for defining test cases and **Newman** for executing tests and generating detailed reports.

## Project Overview

This project aims to ensure that the **Booking API** functions as expected across various endpoints. It verifies that the API handles different scenarios, such as booking creation, retrieval, updates, and cancellations, with correct responses and behavior.

## Key Features of the API Tests:
- **Validation of Key Endpoints:** Tests for critical endpoints like booking creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion.
- **Environment Management:** Dynamic handling of API environment variables, such as base URL, API keys, and tokens.
- **Automated Testing with Newman:** Execution of the tests using Newman with report generation in multiple formats (JSON, HTML).
- **Detailed Reporting:** HTML reports generated with `htmlextra` for comprehensive analysis of test results.

## Setup and Prerequisites

### Required Tools:
- **Node.js (v14 or later):** Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Postman:** Download Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- **Newman:** Install Newman globally on your system using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g newman
  ```

### Newman Reporter: htmlextra

To generate detailed HTML reports, install the `htmlextra` reporter:
```bash
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Running Tests via Postman:**
   - Open Postman.
   - Import the Postman collection (Booking_ApiTesting.json) and environment file (Environment_BookingAPI.json).
   - Select the appropriate environment.
   - Run the collection to execute the test cases directly in Postman.

2. **Running Tests via Newman:**
   You can execute the tests from the command line using Newman.

   **Basic Execution:**
   Run the tests with the following command:
   ```bash
   newman run Booking_ApiTesting.json -e Environment_BookingAPI.json
   ```

3. **Execution with HTML Extra Report:**
   To generate an HTML report after the tests:
   ```bash
   newman run Booking_ApiTesting.json -e Environment_BookingAPI.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export newman-run-report.html
   ```
   This command will create a detailed HTML report (newman-run-report.html) that you can open in any browser.

4. **Automated Testing with Continuous Integration (CI/CD):**
   You can integrate the API testing suite into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) by configuring a job to run the Newman command. This ensures that the tests are executed on every code push or pull request, maintaining the stability of the API.

## Test Descriptions

**Endpoints Tested:**
- **Create Booking (POST):** Validates the ability to create a new booking with valid/invalid data.
- **Get Booking (GET):** Retrieves booking details based on booking ID, testing valid and invalid scenarios.
- **Update Booking (PUT):** Tests updating an existing booking with different sets of data.
- **Delete Booking (DELETE):** Ensures bookings can be deleted correctly and handles edge cases where booking IDs donâ€™t exist.

## Assertions and Validations

- **Status Code Validation:** Verifies that the API returns correct HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.).
- **Response Time Validation:** Ensures that the API responds within an acceptable time frame.
- **Schema Validation:** Confirms that the API responses match the expected JSON schema.
- **Data Validation:** Validates the correctness of data returned by the API, such as booking ID, dates, and user details.

## Reports and Results

**HTML Reports:** The HTML reports generated by Newman using htmlextra are comprehensive. They include:
- Overview of test results (number of passed/failed test cases).
- Request/Response data for each API call.
- Assertion details, showing whether the expected values matched the actual results.
- Response times, highlighting slow API responses.
- Errors and failures, including logs and messages for failed test cases.

**Example reports:**
- `newman-run-report-2024-09-22-12-51-08-091-0.html`
- `Booking Api Testing-2024-09-22-13-21-31-213-0.html`

Open these files in a browser to get a detailed view of the test run.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with CI/CD:** Implement seamless integration with Jenkins or GitLab for automated test execution on code commits.
- **Load Testing:** Extend the test suite to include load testing for the Booking API to evaluate performance under high traffic.
- **Additional Test Cases:** Expand the test coverage to include edge cases and security testing (e.g., rate limiting, and authorization failures).
